# How to design a boss? 

The final boss is more than just a super strong enemy. Before design a boss, you must have defined all the moves and attacks of the player. After that, you can start with three basic points:

* **Learned moves**: the boss encounter is designed around the players set of moves. You don’t need to explain any new mechanic because it suppose the player have mastered.
* **New habilities**:  the boss encounter is designed around the player gaining a new weapon or new moves. The player’s learning curve is part of the boss rounds difficulty. 
* **Combination**: you can mix the 2 previous ways. 

Besides this, you must have to think about these aspects

* **Make a list with the habilities that you want to test on player**: At a bare minimum, all the basic controls of your game should be on this list but often you'll want to test the player on something specific.
* **Make a list of attacks or challenges that will test that ability**: Once you know the skills you want to be on the test, the next step is to get inspired and make a list of attacks that will test those skills.

It is important for them to think about these attacks regardless of any preconceived notion of what the boss can do, or what he is.

## The form follows a function:

Before drawing or establishing the physics of your character you must determine the function that will have. These decisions will determine the work of the other developers of the game; How to program it, how to text it. These decisions you must make will be:

* **Size**
* **Behavior**
* **Speed**
* **Movement**
* **Attacks**
* **Health**
* **Story**
* **Type of Boss**

All these attributes (within the theme of your level) will determine who this character is and how it will look. We go into a little detail:

## Size

Bosses can be of many sizes, but reference should be made to the main character to compare them. The sizes can be:
- **Short**: smaller than the character. Example: Bowser JR.
- **Average**: Same height as the player character. Example: Big Boss - Metal Gear.
- **Large**: Workshop than the player. Example: Bowser.
- **Huge**: At least twice more than the character. Example: Dangoro- Zelda
- **Gigantic**: enemies are so large that they can only be seen from a distance or you can see part of his body. Example: The Guardian- Darksiders 2.

The size of the boss will determine how the player should fight against him. A small boss will be slippery and the player must have aim to attack him. Instead a giant boss must climb over it until it reaches its weak spots. Size also determines the life of the Boss. The larger (usually)the longer life.


The size also shapes the reaction that the boss has with the attacks. Small bosses will easily crash or fly with powerful attacks, but with a large boss you may not get much reaction to the hit. Varying the size of the bosses creates an extra entertainment for the player and avoid the monotony.

If the boss has a large size, like the titans of God of War 3, you can create levels of height to be able to hit the vulnerable area.

A big boss can mean a camera problem. When the boss is very big to put on the scene with the regular camera towards the hero is impossible, you must use an angle in which both the boss, the hero and the stage are detailed. Many games use the camera focusing on the boss to solve this problem. Also several elevations for the cameras are usually used depending on the phase and the distance between the boss and the hero.


## Behavior

Define the behavior of the boss and his reactions to the player's movements.
 * How does my enemy move?
 * What does my enemy do when in combat?
 *What does my enemy do when it is hurt?

These questions should be asked when creating bosses (or enemies). The behavior of the boss must be different from any other character, either to attack or to defend himself or to receive damage.

Let's take a few examples of the types of behavior we can add to our bosses:
- Patroller: moves always with a path, like watchman, is very predictable.
- Chaser: he is always chasing the player, is a particular 2nd phase of the patroller when the character approaches him.
- Shooter: An enemy that fire projectiles. This enemy will try to keep distance between itself and the player.
- Guardian: His mission is guard something, like treasure or a door, his priority is to stay close to the item rather than chase the player.
- Flyer: they are bosses that adds another dimension to the battle and a new way that the player can hurt him. His movements and attacks are more difficult to predict.
- Bomber: A common boss in 2D games, I have fly but he just attack from above.
- Burrower: is a boss that dig into the floor and change his position to attack the player. The player needs to be warned because he can appear everywhere.
- Teleporter: he changes his position but instantaneously, the player needs to be fast to him.
- Blocker: is a boss that has an item that block your hits.
- Doppelganger: It is an unusual boss that imitates the player, his movement and his attacks. He forces the player to use moves or weapons in an unusual way in order to defeat "themselves".

An advantage of determinate the behavior of the boss is that you can design how his / her minion can complement him, creating interesting new way to fight and to solve the "puzzle" that can be defeat to boss.


## Speed 

Depending on speed and movement, a boss can be more dangerous, harder to target and more frightening. Use the different speeds: non - mobile, slow, medium, fast, and quick for your bosses.  You  need to consider all the choice, you can make a non-mobile boss but he throw you big rocks, like the octopus in Mario Galaxy. 
*Slow:  Slow bosses are usually powerful and large and highly defensive.
*Medium:  Is a little bit slower than the player’s speed.
*Fast:  the typical boss that attack and retreat. 
*Quick: Very fast but with limited attacks or movement. 

### The three SS. 

The speed, size and strength of a boss are inversely proportional: 

* Big small enemies fast but not strong. -> -size , +speed , -strength. 
* Big enemies, strong but slow ->  +size, -speed, + strength.

When you design a boss you need equilibrate this 3 aspects, if you create a boss big, but fast and strong you player feel disadvantage.

## Movement

How does the boss move? The movement you do can be from normal walking, jumping like a frog, flying, climbing walls until you flee zigzags. The movement will not only determine the boss's attacks but also his personality. It is important to determine when it will move randomly and when it will move with a pattern to give dynamism to the battle and the player feels challenged but with the possibility of recognizing their patterns. The bosses of the boses should be worked with the programmer who will take care of them. To create a pattern for a boss first you have to ask yourself the following questions:
* **How mobile are your boss?** Do they have more than one movement speed?
How aggressive is your boss? Enemies can even be cautious or cowardly, afraid to get hurt or die. Giving an enemy a sense of self-preservation makes them feel like real people.
* **How defensive is your boss?** Do they have defensive items like shields or defensive system?
* **How versatile is your boss?** Can you pick things from the ground?
Most of the bosses have a waypoint navigation system to move around. If this spots are previously designed the programmer can determine what movement and animations are played to create specific AI behavior.

## Boss Type

* The "Mini Boss": They are versions more powerful of the common enemies and block the progression by the level. Sometimes they can be avoidable, usually their death means nothing in history and usually leave little reward. These mini bosses help to change the gameplay a bit. They are used to test the level at which the player manages the abilities and to verify if it is apt to advance in the level. This boss must comply with the stage design and the minions, it may be a weak version of the final boss.

* The "Stage Boss": These are the commonly considered bosses. They are the strongest enemy of the level and block progress to the next level. This is the example of all Super Mario Galaxy bosses like Bowser Jr., Dino Piranha, Megahammer, or Pokemon Gym Leaders.

* The "Rival-Boss": They are characters created to challenge the player throughout history, usually always retains the same mechanics but is increasing its difficulty, often advancing along with the main character and is not always an enemy. An example of this is Shadow Mario in Super Mario Sunshine.

* The "Final Boss": It is the last battle to complete the game, they are usually the most powerful opponent in all of history and it requires several mechanics to overcome it and usually has more than one phase. It is always a key part of the story and is usually the cause of the conflict. This is the example of Bowser, of Zeus or Ganondorf.

* The "Secret Boss" are secret characters that are only discovered if the player leaves the main path of history, some of them are even more powerful than the "Final Boss".

## Boss attacks 

Your boss need to have attacks to fight against the player. Even if you want to make something new with a super idea, you always will end on one of this 3 options: 

*	Melee attacks: every attack that he can make with a part of his body, like arms, legs, tentacles, etc. even the style to fight, like martial arts or a mega punch to the ground making earthquakes.
*	Weapon combat: Is he using a weapon? A sword, an axe, a hammer?  Can the player disarm the boss? Can the player use this weapon in his favor? 
*	Projectile combat: any gun, magic or spell is considered a projectile weapons. The shoots is gonna be a blindly fire or he will wait for the perfect shot? He reload the gun? Is the projectile explosive, poisoned, stunned? 


### Telegraphing attacks

  A key element for boss battles is the telegraph of boss attacks. The boss should show you or inform you beforehand that he will make an attack so that the player can dodge him. These telegrams can be a sound, a characteristic previous movement, a roar, etc.



### Attack patterns is like a Dance

The heart of every traditional boss fight and are created when several attacks and behaviors are strung together into a predictable sequence. The attacks cycle until there is a break in the pattern initiated by the player, such as the player taking damage, dying, or successfully attacking the boss.  A boss patterns has 4 components, consider this when you design a boss:

- **Primary attack**: it create movement patterns for the player to memorize and follow. Must be easy to remember, but adding some variety to make a more interesting battle. 
- **Invulnerable attack**: is the attack that force the player to take avoiding actions, time to defend to the big laser. 
- **Vulnerable state**: Time to attack! Is the chance the player can hit and make damage?
- **Oportunities**: That means the chances that the player can attack, the opportunity is shorter than the vulnerable state but still has chances. 

Pattern is like a dance because you need to syncronize with the boss pattern to defeat him, knowing when he will atack and when he will be vulnerable. 



### Type of Attacks

Not every attack need to damage to the player. There are many options to hit a player without damage him:
-	Block: this can be usefull to break the player combat flows or reseting combos.
-	Knockback : Hay golpes que solo empujan al jugador, como los hechios expansivos en “The witcher”. 
-	Stun: the plaer is stunned and is defendless for a few seconds losing the combat control. 
-	Freezing/paralyzing/catpturing:  its like stunning but can be broken with button mashing. 
-	Healing: the boss regains health. You can decide if the player can disrupt this healing. 
-	Buff: Like the heal but gaining power or some new attack. 
-	Leech: the boss drains the players life or mana or fuel if is the case. 

### Vulnerabilities or resistances 

Make sure that the player can see the logic of the boss and can make an attack plan. Let the player make logical connections, don’t let space for wonderings, use taunts to show that details, even if is a super fierce boss with a giant shield there still has to be a way to kill them.  


### On battle

Provide plenty of opportunities for the player to regain health or power during the fight. Tools like dynamic difficulty will programmatically determine what the player needs to succeed. You can apply dynamic difficulty to enemy AI, reaction times — in fact, just about anything. Delivering the right power- up exactly when the player needs it makes the boss fight feel exciting and dramatic.
The last strike of the fight needs to be delivered by the player. It’ s very important psychologically for the player to feel that they have won.

## Location 

The place where the hero is going to defeat the boss. It is an extension of the boss or in some case, the level is the boss. Usually the level is a circular arena, why?, to improve the camera view. Often you can make a vertical level where you need to climb.

You need to think about how the boss will be related with the level. How will use the level in his favor? Can he re-dimensioned the level breaking things. You need to consider to how the player can use the level in his favor? Maybe you can use the trees around the boss to smash him. 

You can design a scrolling battle, where the battle is not in just one level, instead is in 3 or 4 places to make the battle always dynamic.  Another type is the puzzle boss, a boss that you need to solve a puzzle on the level to make hit him.


## Story

You should consider How is the boss related to the character? What does the boss represent? There are 3 types of boss you can implement:
* Physical adversary: Large, heavily armed and strong.
* Mental adversary: A mastermind, always giving a puzzle to solve, or a weak guy who has his own super homemade robot. 
* Global threat: this isn’t a person, he can be the situation or the problem like the timer on a nuclear bomb, or GladOS, that along the way is a global threat but in the end is an a mental adversary. 
What makes the boss a worthy adversary? 

What does the boss represent to the hero?  The boss is an obstacle to the hero, he can be the principal problem on the history or actually he can be psychologic problem, like your devil inner. 

What are the motivation and goals to the boss? Just more than “cause he is evil”, you can start with the seven sins, for example, but whatever the motivation is, it has to conflict with the hero’s own. 

What is the boss’s job?  Usually the bosses are guardians, but you can use a profesion like he is a rider so he ride a super bike, something that synergize with his actitude. 


### Boss Promotion
The player needs to be informed how awesome, dangerous, vile, etc the boss is through cutscenes, dialog, or any number of other methods. The player also needs to be trained on the skills he'll need to beat the boss.   It is, therefore, important to train your players on how to fight the boss. Most often, this is done during the build-up to the fight.

Anticipation is also really important for the pacing of your game. If you want your boss to feel like an emotional milestone, you want to create anticipation in the player to increase intensity and to raise the emotional stakes.


### Boss introduction 


The introductions are quite effective, they serve to inform the player that they are going to find something new, exciting and dangerous.
• Freeze the camera or zoom the boss so that the player can detail it well.
• Name the boss
• Create pre-boss scenes in which the player begins to meet the boss.
Inside the introduction you should also think about how it will appear on the battlefield. The player must understand that he is the villain, and that eventually you must fight with him. To the boss you must give him his moment to show who he is, doing something that represents his evil, Eating or killing an NPC for example, or also that previously other characters or events tell you about this enemy. In addition to the introduction you should also think about how it will disappear from the scene once dead.

### Why beat him? 

When you design a boss you need to define why the player will want beat him. Your job is to make the player want to take the risk of dying. Here you a have a list of motivations to beat a boss: 
* He have the loot: EXP, Gold, Gems. 
* He block the way.
* The player can drain the boss power is he beat him. 

# Tips 

* Only when you have all these aspects defined is that you should start thinking about the aspect that the boss will have, and you will have a structure mounted and a path much easier to go because the skeleton is already assembled, it is only necessary to join the pieces and will practically come out alone.

* Try to look at the bosses of other games, there is a high probability that you find the type of boss you want to create, and besides, after knowing the structure of a boss you can analyze the bosses of other games and learn from his strengths and weaknesses.
